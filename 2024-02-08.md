Machine learning models will be most vulnerable to adversarial attacks at points the model explicitly learned incorrectly due to the fault of incorrectly assigned labels during training. 

Thus, to locate these vulnerable points, we use the signal that allows us to identify mislabeled points in the first place.

$$
\Delta x = \nabla_{x}\mid\mid \lambda(\mathbf{H}_{f}(x))\mid\mid^2_{2}
$$
Therefore, we can iteratively traverse the feature space by randomly choosing a starting point $x$, and following the gradient field formed by $\nabla_{x}\mid\mid \lambda(\mathbf{H}_{f}(x))\mid\mid^2_{2}$ to a local maximum.
