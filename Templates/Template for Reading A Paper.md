> [!info] Paper Type:
>*Choose any that apply, delete the rest:*
*Survey w/ No Implementation (Aggregates and summarizes previous work)*
*Survey w/ Implementation (Aggregates, summarizes, and experiments on previous work)*
*Dataset (Created a new dataset for benchmarking, experiments for a domain / task)*
*Architecture (Proposes a new model)*
*Loss Function (Proposed a new loss function)*
*Optimization (Proposed a new way of conducting optimization)*
*System (Proposes either a new system, or new combination of components)*
*Applied (We took solution X from domain Y, and showed it also works in domain Z)*
*Theoretical (We proved phenomenon X always holds under assumptions under Y and Z)*

> [!info]  Paper Impact Quality:
>*Choose One, delete the rest:*
*Niche (Provides a novel contribution, but only applicable to a highly specific topic)*
*Impactful (Provides a novel contribution, and has modest impact to the broader community)*
*Masterful (Pushes an existing topic of research significantly forward, very applicable to the broader community)*
*Seminal (Landmark paper in the field, burgeons a completely new topic)

> *Choose One, delete the rest:* 
*Simple (Understood it in 1-2 passes)* replace info with check
*Medium (Understood it in 3-5 passes)* don't replace info
*Challenging (Read it 5+ times and still struggling)* replace info with danger

> [!info] Math Difficulty: 
*Choose One, delete the rest:*
*Simple (Could explain conceptually and technically after first detailed pass)* replace info with check
*Medium (Not immediately obvious to understand on first detailed pass, but could explain* *conceptually and could self-derive or explain technically if questioned.)* don't replace info
*Challenging (Could explain conceptually, but couldn't self-derive or explain technically if questioned.)* replace info with warning
*Esoteric (Difficult to understand conceptually and couldn't self-derive or explain technically if questioned.)* replace info with danger

*Choose One, delete the rest:* 
*N/A (Haven't tried to self-replicate any results)*
*Plug-And-Play (Author open-sourced code I can nearly immediately use to replicate experiments)*
*Simple (Had to replicate from scratch, but did fairly quickly)*
*Medium (Had to replicate from scratch, but took some debugging and retrying to work)*
*Challenging (Had to replicate from scratch, and took a long time to get right)*
*Impossible (Tried to replicate from scratch, could never replicate their results)*

### 5. **What other references do you want to follow?**
### 6. **What was the most challenging part to understand?**

### 7. **What helped improve your understanding the quickest?** 
**(ie. a figure, a subsection, etc.)**
